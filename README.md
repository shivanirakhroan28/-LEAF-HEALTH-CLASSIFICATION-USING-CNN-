# -LEAF-HEALTH-CLASSIFICATION-USING-CNN-

This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify the health status of plant leaves based on image data. The objective is to accurately detect whether a leaf is healthy or infected (with diseases such as rust, blight, mildew, etc.) using deep learning techniques.

# Problem Statement
Farmers and agriculturists often struggle to detect plant diseases in their early stages. Manual inspection is not only time-consuming but also prone to human error. This project aims to automate the detection of plant leaf diseases through image classification, thereby helping improve agricultural productivity and crop health monitoring.

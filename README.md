# -LEAF-HEALTH-CLASSIFICATION-USING-CNN-

This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify the health status of plant leaves based on image data. The objective is to accurately detect whether a leaf is healthy or infected (with diseases such as rust, blight, mildew, etc.) using deep learning techniques.
